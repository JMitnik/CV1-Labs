In this assignment, we will implement an algorithm that aims to identify corner features in an image: Harris Corner Detection. We then compare it to an improved algorithm proposed by Shi and Tomasi. The second part is about Optical Flow (the apparent flow in pixels from one frame to the other) in images will be analysed using the Lucas-Kanade Algorithm. Following this, the movement of objects across different frames is tracked. This is done by combining the two previously mentioned algorithms. Relevant corners points of object are detect by using Harris Corner Detection, which will be tracked using Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow. The final result will be animations showing the optical flow of these points over a period of time.
